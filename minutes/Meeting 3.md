## Meeting 3

##### Location: 
Mechatronics Lab

##### Date: 
11/05/2023
##### Time: 
9am to 12pm

#### Attendees: 
Hiroshi, Richard, Ruchir, Will and Quinn

### REPORTS
 - It was found that the PTU uses PWM and not I2C for the LIDAR.
 - Ruchir made good progress on the ADC module with a trimpot used to dictate the amount of LEDs that would turn on using the STM32F3 Discovery board interface.

### AGENDA: 
   - Discuss whether rolling averages will be needed to get rid off noise for the sensors
   - Discuss how exercises will be presented during demo
   - Discuss whether interrupts should be used instead of polling for lidar task

### TASK ALLOCATIONS
   + Hiroshi was allocated to the LIDAR exercise
   + Quinn to keep working on the TSC module playing Fur Elise
   + Richard to keep working on combination lock, with few tweaks made to the challenge
 

### NEXT MEETING TIME AND LOCATION
   â€¢ Group to meet up during the week before the next lab session to test modules out using the PTU
